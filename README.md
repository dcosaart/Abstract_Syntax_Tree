# Abstract_Syntax_Tree
Repo for project three of CS510: Programming Language Concepts

This is an F# webapp using the Suave framework that takes MicroML as input
Then, using the FsLexYacc library, the MicroML is parsed into bracket notation
Last, the bracket notation is transformed into a jsSyntaxTree using a library by http://ironcreek.net/syntaxtree
